As a result, shipping is way more expensive than (in my opinion) it should be.</p><p>So far, fortunately, I have not had to pay customs/ duties yet. However, espiecially with COVID-19, packages/ mail from the US have taken <strong>way</strong> longer to arrive, but at least with Canada Post, domestic mail <em>seems</em> to be working fine.</p><p>I still love my planner shops from the US and other shops, and will continue supporting them when I can as usual, but I also realized that I didn&rsquo;t really know/ have a good list of specifically Canadian planner sticker shops.</p><p>So, I made one!</p><p><strong>You can <a href=/resources#canadian-sticker-shops>view it here</a>.</strong></p><p>If you want to help maintain the list, add your own shop, or add some shops, please <a href=/about>contact me</a>.</p><hr><p><code>My order from SimplyAMess sticker shop!</code></p><p><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDAHpefpLVs/>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDAHpefpLVs/</a></p></content><p><a href=https://letteredplans.earne.link/tags/sticker-shops/>#sticker shops</a>
