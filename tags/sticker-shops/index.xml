&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve done my best to compile a list of Canadian planner sticker shops. This came out of the video below, as most of you know, while I do like my stickers, a lot of the time I am on a no spend ðŸ˜¢.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>

&lt;p>In the past, a lot of shops I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased from were based in the US. However, as a Canadian, even though we are right next to the border, it does count as international shipping. As a result, shipping is way more expensive than (in my opinion) it should be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, fortunately, I have not had to pay customs/ duties yet. However, espiecially with COVID-19, packages/ mail from the US have taken &lt;strong>way&lt;/strong> longer to arrive, but at least with Canada Post, domestic mail &lt;em>seems&lt;/em> to be working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still love my planner shops from the US and other shops, and will continue supporting them when I can as usual, but I also realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know/ have a good list of specifically Canadian planner sticker shops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I made one!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You can &lt;a href="https://letteredplans.earne.link/resources#canadian-sticker-shops">view it here&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to help maintain the list, add your own shop, or add some shops, please &lt;a href="https://letteredplans.earne.link/about">contact me&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
